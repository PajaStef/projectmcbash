Easy way to setup a MC Server!

Hello, this is projectmcbash. This script eases the task of creating a MC Server. 
Its simple. Provide version and ram usage to the script, then script will use BuildTools.jar from jenkins to build the spigot server.
Script needs execute permission, if they are not already granted use this command: command: sudo chmod +x mc.sh
